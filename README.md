Video game sales data analysis for the ICE company.

**Objective:** The objective of this project is to assist the ICE store, an online video game store that sales worldwide, performing a comprehensive analysis of their video game sales data in order to prepare their marketing strategy for year 2017. They are particularly interested in spotting potential top selling games, as well as the public's preferred genre and platforms, and whether these preferences change according to the client's geographic location. 

**Method:** In the first stage the data was prepared by dealing with missing values, checking for duplicates, making sure that each column has the correct type of data and creating any relevant additional columns derived from the ones we already have.

Then, an analysis was performed in order to identify: 
-The lifespan of a platform 
-Platforms expected to be the most relevant for 2017 
-The impact of user and critic score in the total sales for each game 
-Genres with the highest and lowest sales 
-ESRB ratings with highest and lowest sales 
-Preferences by region: platform and genre.

Finally, the following hypotheses were tested: 
—Average user ratings of the Xbox One and PC platforms are the same. 
—Average user ratings for the Action and Sports genres are different.

**Conclusions:** 

-Among other conclusions, it was discovered that platforms tend to have a lifespan of about ten years, so no marketing efforts should go to older platforms. Except for PS3 and the X360, these have managed to stay relevant in the market. 

-Action games are the preferred genre.

-Some specific games show an extraordinary level of sales, they are "Call of duty" and "FIFA". Any new release from these franchises should be addressed by a marketing campaign.

-Buyer profiles were created for the different geographic regions focusing on their preferred platforms and genres.
